I have been learning Arabic through Duolingo, the Alif Ba, and Al-Kitaab series. While I am familiar with Machine Learning and it's applications to NLP, I am only familiar with the challegenes in the English Language space. This notebook is created to demonstrate the unique challeneges for NLP in the Arabic languages and how to address them.
